# 1. Configuration
First, you configure the bot in the config.py file. You open it with any code editor. And you fill it according to your preferences.
You can get the token from: https://twitchtokengenerator.com/
You choose the option: "Bot Chat Token", you authorize and confirm that you are a human.

Then go to the "Generated tokens" section and copy ACCES_TOKEN
Paste it in the place designated in the config and you're done.



Now you can test whether the bot really works. If you already have Python installed on your computer, run main.bat file by doubble clicking it. If you don't have python, install it from the Microsoft Store. (if you have a different system or don't know how to do it see tutorial on YouTube)

If you configured everything correctly, the bot should start.
